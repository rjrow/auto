$1,1968 Buick Skylark,,/evl/cto/4637339036.html,"
        1968 Buick Skylark. Proper professional body work done, I do show winning cars, this car has a very good cutting and buffing. This only needs a few days of TLC to be a daily driver. It's not an over built muscle car. An average non enthusiast would easily be able to manage this and get decent mileage for what it is. It has a chevy engine swap. 350 4 bolt main block. a mild COMP CAM, approx 272 duration. Mildly Ported heads. Headers. engine combo matching proper Intake and proper carb (that isn't an over sized gas hog) to compliment the rpm range and power of the engine. The interior is close to restored to flawless. the front seats are brand new adjustable bucket padded race seats, but the back seats could use a re upholster if that matters to the buyer. I have pictures of the car with a set of new 20 inch TIS rims and BRAND new tires, 255/35/20 but I do have a set of older style Buick rally's 14 inch rims, with good tires and I'll negotiate the price down if I remove the 20's. AS IS.. I will NOT take a penny less than $6500. If you want to trade I need $5000 cash plus the trade. I DO NOT want to pay someone else to sell my car so don't solicit me.

        I started this project and I am not even sure I want to sell it yet, but I'm  testing the waters,
Its a 1990 4runner that I pulled the 3.0 to swap a 3.4 v6 in it. ,
The engine is a 2000 Tacoma prerunner with 120,000 miles on it,  running when pulled and with the engine I have the harness as well. ,
Also I have the stock v6 r151f transmission to go with it.,
Have a complete gear driven transfer case with extra half case and parts to build a crawl box.,
Also a 85 solid axle housing to do an SAS as well.,
I started building a set of half doors and since I am still not sure if I am going to part yet I am still working on them. Also with a set of stock doors not cut up.,
I pulled the rear carpet I was going to put a built in drawer system in. ,
I am interested if the project well sell for a decent price text me if interested and I will also send photos to serious people. ,
Thank you ,

        This is a good running vehicle asking $500 or willing to trade for? Let me know what ya got. The worse can happen is I say no. Has been well-maintained and always serviced on time. Been sitting for a year used to be my sons car but he has since moved out and buy himself a Mustang. So what has been sitting for the last year and the only problem I see is the clutch is soft the paddle seems like there is little to no pressure. However it was working when it was parked and about six months ago I bled it and seem like it drove just fine. Then it again went to little to no pressure. Car does have a $200 title loan on it. This is why I had it listed so cheap. Car has no dents and all glass on the car is in good condition also has a moonroof has warranty on new tires and new feel pump warranty.

no low ballers or commercial offers,
Clean Title, no accidents, literally as brand new as private party gets. ,
This Toyota Tundra is as close to brand new as they come, is has less than 150 miles on it!,
(Literally just the 2 hour drive home, all highway). ,
I haven't even pulled the info tabs off of the interior, I took the MSRP sticker off the passenger window, connected my iPod to the bluetooth stereo, (which sounds pretty dang good for an entry level truck) and drove home. ,
Yes it's a V6, but driving through mountains with 6% grades going 70mph, I still had plenty of passing power, and the onboard computer recorded over 18mpg trip average.,
I bought this truck as a gift for my son, but he says its to much and won't accept it.,
My loss, your gain. ,
I am asking $27,000 O.B.O. which is less than the MSRP, Plus your saving several thousand in dealer fees and taxes. Your saving easily $4,000+, just because I drove it home once before you. ,

        100k mi. I want to sell it for what I have into it. The head gaskets are toast. The interior is a 8.5 out of 10, and the exterior although straight and never wrecked needs to be re-cleared. The name Jaguar makes the job sound difficult, but the heads are easily accessible and no more difficult to change than a Honda x2.  If you have the time to swap the gaskets and refinish the clear coat this car books at $4600.00. I have just exhausted my efforts, so come get it. Clean and clear box a title, and key in hand. Call text or email ,
price is obo so make me a reasonable offer, I do have access to a tow truck. Color is dark dark greenish blue with peanut butter interior and walnut trim/ pictures tomorrow.

$2200,2005 Chevrolet Cobalt , (Paradise Valley),/nph/cto/4704506303.html,"
        *** If this Ad is still up, the car is still available for purchase***,
For sale is my 2005 Chevrolet Cobalt. It is the base model cobalt (LS). The car currently has 189,xxx miles on it. I have taken this car from Minnesota to Florida twice, Minnesota to Denver, and Minnesota to Arizona all within the last 12 months. Made all of these trips without any issues. The car runs and drives well, however I will run through the pros and cons. Please read through these and if you're interested, you can find more information regarding pricing at the bottom.,
Pros:,
-Clean title,
-Car gets pretty solid gas mileage. In the city you're getting around 26 and freeway around 32,
-Next to new tires,
-Just got an alignment,
-Car has been owned by my family since 25,000 miles,
-Interior is pretty clean for a car with this mileage,
-Serpentine belt replaced ~3,000 miles ago,
-Air filter replaced a month ago,
Cons:,
This car is not perfect. It was used as a commuter car for construction work. A lot of these cons are cosmetic.,
-Missing rear passenger hubcap ,
-Dent in passenger side door,
-Paint chipping on lower side of drivers door (larger chipping, a few 4x4 inch chunks),
-brake pads will need replacing within the next 3,000 miles (in my opinion),
-You need to press a button to release the key. Tumbler is broke. Functions normal if you press button.,
With all of this being said, the car is in good running condition. It has almost 190k on it, its certainly not perfect. It will however get you from point A to point B, with pretty solid reliability and gas mileage. I'm asking $2,200 O.B.O. I feel like this is a pretty fair price, however I am open to offers. I'd really like to sell it by this weekend (10/10-10/12). Because of this, if you make a reasonable offer, odds are I will take it. I just purchased a new vehicle and don't have the room in my driveway. ,
Please TEXT me at 480-335-42 three one, or email me via the link up top. No calls please. You are welcome to text me and request a call back, however my occupation requires me to be available for calls during business hours, and thus can not discuss personal matters. I will add photos within the next 24 hours, and will snap a few in the morning. Text me if you'd like to see any. Thanks for your interest. ,

 I prefer a 2003 50th Anniversary Corvette Convertible in like new condition.,
 A little history on the car: The car left the factory on Friday, July 30, 1965 this was the last full day of production for 1965 Corvettes; though Corvettes 23562 and 563 were built on Monday August 2nd to empty the assembly line (one was rumored to be a 396 car). The line had to be cleared so it could be refitted to build the 1966 Corvettes. This car was built 80 cars from the end of 1965 production so you don't find much later in production then this every day. A GM rep from Albuquerque bought the car for his wife new and the car has remained in Albuquerque its whole life. This is a factory original Black Exterior - Black Interior -- Black Convertible Top car. . . You read that correctly. . . It's a Rare-Rare-Rare triple black car!!! The original motor was rebuilt but had been decked so all of the numbers on the engine stamping pad were lost. That engine was rebuilt by a questionable person so 327/365hp engine that was installed in the car was removed by the last owner. The original 3.55:1 Posi rear end and transmission are still in the car and were rebuilt when the engine was replaced 3 or 4 years ago. Power steering was added by the GM rep for his wife when the car was new. The true miles are unknown because the odometer was not working when the last owner got the car. The odometer shows about 79000 miles and I would say the car had less than 100K miles on it just based on the condition all the original stuff is still in. . . ,
 When the car was purchased by its last owner, about 8 years ago, the car had been setting for many years unused and this took a toll on the mechanicals on the car. It is unclear if the engine that was in the car was the original engine but the dates were consistent with an end of production vehicle. The car was originally equipped with a 365hp engine based on the fuel line that runs between the body and frame and the gauge package, still having all the original gauges. That engine was removed and placed on a stand. In the 327's place was put a very strongly built small block 400 CID with a 4-bolt main, cast crankshaft, shot-peened 350 rods, custom forged pistons and Air Flow Research aluminum heads with screw-in studs and guide plates, stainless steel valves, roller tipped rockers and a hydraulic roller camshaft. The engine was balanced and fit with a light-weight flywheel. The valve train is capped with small block LT-1 Valve covers to accommodate breathers as the FI unit was designed to run with a block breather that is found on the 327 engine. The compression was calculated to be just a little over 10.25:1. There is a modified 6qt. trap-door oil pan with windage tray on the engine so power steering could still be used on the car. The true icing on the top of this cake is the Factory Corvette Rochester Fuel Injection System (The serial number places it about mid-late 1964 production). The fuel injection system was rebuilt with a new spider tube assembly, axle and fly-weights with new seals, gaskets being installed throughout including the high pressure pump and all the expensive jewelry in fuel meter. This system is installed in a way to give as close to an original look as possible with an original (and very expensive) FI radiator core support, and ""S"" tube, the air filter housing and elbow are made of fiberglass and painted to look as the originals did down to the printed instruction for servicing the air filter element. The FI Distributor was rebuilt and converted to a modern single wire Transistor Ignition unit so it does appear to have a single point wire coming out of the distributor. To the untrained eye this looks like an original Fuel injected Corvette. On the way up plus side to the build this engine will never need a valve adjustment or points replaced and it still has the sound of a mechanical lifter engine with the full-roller cam and rockers! There are factory Ram's Horn 2.5"" exhaust manifolds on the car with an off-road exhaust system with a very nice rumble to it with much larger exhaust tips than original. This engine was dyno tested at near 470hp!!! Oh, did I mention this thing is freaking FAST!!!,
 The chassis found its way to some work as well. The brake system was completely overhauled and functions perfectly with no leaks. The rear trailing arms rebuilt receiving new bearings and seals. The front control arms bushings are not brand new but they are not original either. The ball joints and bushings have been replaced and have not seen a lot of use and are still as tight as new. The power steering control valve and hoses were replaced and the car has had a fresh 4-wheel alignment. The Wide Ratio M-20 transmission was rebuilt and shifter perfectly through all gears either shifting up or shifting down! The factory shifter got some custom touches as well. Original corvette transmission shift arms have a long and a short throw setting. The long throw is way too mushy and the short throw is a bit short and stiff. . . The original transmission shift arms were milled with new holes (done at the same time the transmission was being rebuilt) and the new position give a very respectable shorter throw with little to no added effort! It is truly the best of both worlds. The rear differential had a fluid change with new posi-traction additive installed when the drive train was rebuilt. There is a complete new under-car exhaust system using all GM exhaust pipes to they fit the car well and the mufflers are reproductions of the 3-baffle GM off-road exhaust system. The tone of the exhaust is perfect, not too quiet (for him) and not too loud (for her). . . It sounds just like a high HP Corvette should. One of the Good things about the chassis, and most of this car, is there are no weird parts on it... For the most part if you buy parts for a 1965 Corvette and they will work. The only real exception to this is the engine as it has need modified and it is not out of a 1965 Corvette. ,
 The interior: The carpets are new. The door panels are new: The door latching mechanisms and window regulators were cleaned and repaired as needed. The vent window regulators were replaced with far better units than ever came on a corvette and will last for a long-long time. The glove box door was refinished and the interior of the glove box interior replaced. The radio was removed and serviced by a radio repair shop and functions perfectly. The clock still has the original mechanical movement that was rebuilt and functions perfectly. The dash pads are in very good condition and are free of cracks. All of the glass in the doors is in wonderful condition. The original vinyl convertible top was removed and replaced this year with a ""Hartz"" Cloth Top cut to the exact same specifications as the factory original tops were and it fit without any wrinkles and the back window and looks GREAT!!! The seats are in very good condition and the tracks have been cleaned and lubed and the vinyl shines nicely and presents like new. . . The gauge cluster was completely restored with all the gauges being tested, rebuilt and restored as needed. The Mechanical Tachometer and Speedometer were rebuilt and calibrated and are completely accurate. An accurate tachometer is important because this engine with all that horse-power and light flywheel will snap-throttle to 6-grand in the blink of an eye. . . ,
 The body/exterior: The car had been fitted with fender flare, ugly fat wheels and a poor quality aftermarket 1967 Big Block Hood that had been put on the car years ago to clear a very high intake manifold and carburetor. . . The flares were removed and the car repainted about 4 or 5 years ago. The hood was replaced with an original small block hood as the same time the flare and paint work was done. The big block reproduction POS hood was removed and a correct original Corvette small block hood was installed on the car prior to it being repainted with a base/clear coat. The headlight motors were rebuilt so they operate very nicely as well. The car has the CO1 Option so back-up lights and day/night mirror are on the car as well. The bumpers were re-plated and are in new condition. The windshield trim was removed from the interior and exterior and then professionally polished. The windshield is very nice and has a new rubber seal around it. The rest of the bright-work on the exterior of this car is just like new. The side rocker panels were polished to an ultra-bright finish and the black accent was painted with the same paint at the car. The wheels on the car are brand new American Torque Thrust ""M""'s 17 X 7's with gloss black centers. The new P235/55/17 Yokahama tires are directional and rated for 150mph. The power antenna also works very nicely and goes up and down quietly. Much time was spent making sure that everything works correctly on the car and that it looks good too. This car is very correct and complete and very easy to drive. The alignment is perfect and everything works You can drive this car to any show and be proud of it, as it is!,
 Pictures really do not do this car justice... When you see this car in person you'll be deeply impressed with how it really looks... If you have question and would like to talk more about the car please send me your contact information and I will get back in touch with you. The reserve on the car is fair and quite a bit less than you could buy and build a car like this car. There will be a Buy-it-Now price for the car and if this price option is used the purchase the vehicle that price WILL include the date correct 1965 327/365hp complete engine assembly with a correct carburetor and intake manifold and a 1966/67 Black Hardtop in good condition. If the Buy-it-Now option is not used I WILL NOT and repeat WILL NOT be including the engine assembly or the hardtop and they will be sold separately. ,
 Overall the car really needs nothing and it's ready to drive and show right now!!! -- As It Is.

$3000,ford bronco, (East Mesa),/evl/cto/4690339440.html,"
        Selling my 1983 Ford Bronco 4x4. It has an 89 front clip. The engine is a clean 351W that runs very strong with tons of power. It has dual exhaust and sounds mean. It has a brand new battery with new terminals. New 1406 Edelbrock carb. Also just got a new windshield. The tires are 35"" all-terrains with a good amount of tread on them. Also has a new pioneer deck and new speakers in the back. All windows go up and down just fine. The electric rear window also does work. The paint itself isn't perfect, and the engine could use a tune up. The center console is missing as well. It does have the spare tire rack for the back, however I do have it off. It is a 3 speed automatic transmission and has posi rear end. No trades. $3000 obo

$85000,2013 Jeep JK Rubicon Pre-Runner, (Tucson),/cph/cto/4678276641.html,"
        MY LOSS YOUR GAIN. . ...,
One of a kind long travel 2013 Jeep Jk done right. You won't find another one like it. This build is for the serious off-road enthusiast that likes to go fast. All of the best parts and professionally installed. Started with a $40k Rubicon and put in over $60k aftermarket.  First $85K takes it. This jeep took 9 months to build. Low miles on motor, not even 1000 miles on new suspension set up, just broke in gears and tested/tunned shocks. And this jeep works! MUST SEE and DRIVE to fully appreciate.  Add a supercharger or V8 engine swap and you have a real monster on your hands. This thing turns heads everywhere. Vinyl logos and/or wrap can be removed at buyers request. Jeep color is black. $85,000.00 Firm,

$1,principality of Monaco thunderbird, (madison wi),/wvl/cto/4629287584.html,"
        I just found this 1963 Principality of Monaco bird. It is number 1964 of 2000. All body numbers match data plate but unfortunately looks like someone cut the roof off and painted it red. These mods were done prior to 1996 when previous owner bought the car. The car was originally from Arizona and there are stickers in window for radio station in arizona. The story I got was it was a radio give away many years ago.  The original motor was blown up and someone put a 352 in but I also received the original 390 block with the car. The block needs to be sleeved on two cylinders but totally usable. I am new to the thunderbirds and really kind of green when it comes to specifics so I am looking for any input someone may have for a car like this. It is a driving car that is in pretty good shape for 50+. I drive it about once a week just for fun.  Whoever presumably cut the roof off also added a removable hardtop but it is in really bad shape and not worth damaging car putting it on and off. I am willing to sell the car but not sure what it would be worth and need to confirm it isn't more special then I think it is.,

$1,1963 thunderbird limited edition POM, (madison wi),/cph/cto/4629279131.html,"
        I just found this 1963 Principality of Monaco bird. It is number 1964 of 2000. All body numbers match data plate but unfortunately looks like someone cut the roof off and painted it red. These mods were done prior to 1996 when previous owner bought the car. The car was originally from Arizona and there are stickers in window for radio station in arizona. The story I got was it was a radio give away many years ago.  The original motor was blown up and someone put a 352 in but I also received the original 390 block with the car. The block needs to be sleeved on two cylinders but totally usable. I am new to the thunderbirds and really kind of green when it comes to specifics so I am looking for any input someone may have for a car like this. It is a driving car that is in pretty good shape for 50+. I drive it about once a week just for fun.  Whoever presumably cut the roof off also added a removable hardtop but it is in really bad shape and not worth damaging car putting it on and off. I am willing to sell the car but not sure what it would be worth and need to confirm it isn't more special then I think it is.,

$1,***2003 VW Jetta***, (Gilbert),/evl/cto/4612983670.html,"
        I have a 2003 VW jetta for sale. It is the 2.0 4 cylinder. Has 115k miles which is very low. Would like to sell or trade. Car runs very well. It's a 5 speed manual and it shifts like butter. I normally get 30 mpg.,
The goods:,
I have replaced the ignition coils and the spark plugs along with a k&n air filter. Has a new catalytic converter and O2 censor. I recently replaced the front struts and rear shocks. Tie rod ends are new. I just put in a new thermostat and coolant. The rear hub bearings were worn out so I replaced them as well. Has an aftermarket deck with aux and USB, stock speakers sound great so I never replaced them. New headlights. New driver side door handle. Has aftermarket wheels and low profile tires. The car is black, and so are the wheels. Looks sweet.,
The bads:,
The brake pad wear sensor is on and so is the abs light. The speed sensor has a cut wire which needs to be reconnected or replaced. There is a dent in the driver door from someone backing into it. The rear left window doesn't roll down, however the motor works so I'm thinking it just off track. Also the rear tires are at the end of their life. ,
Cash is king but I'm also looking to see what trades are out there, looking for something else manual is preferred but let me know what you have, cars trucks. No junk, no bikes, no Hondas. I have a lot of time and money into this car and it is very reliable so please do not low ball me as I will not respond.,
Thanks for looking! Call or Text at  480 213 699four. If I do not answer please leave a message and I will get back to you. "

$14900,2004 Jeep Wrangler 4WD, (ahwatukee),/evl/cto/4704513814.html,"
        2004 Jeep Wrangler 4WD, Black, straight 6 cyl (inline 4.0 liter), 5 speed manual transmission, Hard Top, tinted glass, cold A/C. VERY well maintained, 68k miles, 2nd owner, garaged. Also has full soft top and a Safari top. Excellent 31"" BFG A/T tires with few miles on them (best all around SUV tire on the market IMHO). Never lifted or modified. Power Steering, tilt, cruise, running boards, brand new battery, tow package, Alarm/remote, trail rated.,
This is a great looking Jeep and in great condition. Never wrecked, no AZ pin striping, no trail damage. 3.73 gears so the housing will take an upgrade if that is what you want. Great for Sedona, the lakes, desert trails and as a daily driver/grocery grabber. This will handle snow, rain, deep sand and travel smooth and quiet at hiway speeds. Jeep Wrangler has the best resale value of any other vehicle on the market. If you're a Jeep guy or gal, you understand why.,
We respectfully do NOT need help selling the vehicle, nor are we interested,
in a ""trade-in"" value offer. Dealers and brokers, let's not waste each,
other's time. KBB has it at $16,047.
